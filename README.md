A microservice meant to grab data from brokers' APIs on a daily scheduler. Working app once db and api keys are setup. Abandoned project, using this as a demo now to show what I worked on with C# and .NET Core. ( Only contains business logic for data retrieval and storage, no endpoints; data was accessed locally through direct connection to database, was enough for my purposes )
